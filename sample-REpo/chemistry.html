<h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

<p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

<h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

<p>The <dfn>periodic table</dfn> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its <dfn>chemical symbol</dfn>, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

<h2>Chemical Equations</h2>

<p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>

<pre>
2H₂ + O₂ -> 2H₂O
</pre>

<p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) to form water (H₂O).</p>

<h2>Important Concepts</h2>

<p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>

<p><b>Subscripts</b> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <b>superscripts</b> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
